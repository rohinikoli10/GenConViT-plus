Deepfakes are highly realistic, AI-generated videos that can convincingly depict people saying or doing things they never did. These convincing fakes can spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and even damage personal and professional reputations. Our solution uses advanced AI and machine learning to detect deepfake videos by analyzing facial expressions, speech patterns, and contextual cues, enhancing accuracy with video preprocessing techniques.
