# GenConViT-plus
The propagation of deepfake videos has introduced serious concerns, particularly in their potential to Circulate misleading details and
undermine the integrity of digital media. In response to this challenge, we present the Generative Convolutional Vision Transformer
(GenConViT) as a robust solution for deepfake video detection. GenConViT integrates the strengths of ConvNeXt and Swin Transformer
models with a 3D Convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract relevant features. It further harnesses the capabilities of Autoencoders
and Variational Autoencoders to discern patterns in latent data distribution. Our modelâ€™s proficiency is validated through rigorous training
and evaluation on four distinct datasets. DFDC, FF++, DeepFakeTIMIT, and Celeb-DF (v2). The results speak volumes, with GenConViT
achieving notably high classification accuracy, F1 Scores, and AUC values. It rises to the challenge of generalizability in deepfake
detection by effectively differentiating a wide spectrum of falsified videos while upholding the integrity of digital media.
